It is a restructured extract from the popular communications package: IT++
		http://itpp.sourceforge.net


The main objective of this package is three-fold.

1. Reduce the burden of installation, which is observed to be painful for many.

Details: This perception of a painful installation process especially originates
due to the option of specialized lapack, blas and mkl modules. From the package
documentation, these modules appear to be optional but the error messages that
we finally get are scary and leave a confusion of what happened at the end of the day.

2. Provide an instantly useful package with least overhead on compilation.

Details: Not everyone has a problem with compilation time. More often, the
problem is a quick start. The popular answer to this is to include full source
files + header files directly, instead of just headers and then link the
pre-compiled modules (-litpp for including libitpp.so or libitpp.a) from the
PATH.

3. A vector-matrix-only package (except for the inverse and the svd)

Details: IT++ has a powerful syntax that is closest to MATLAB and user-friendly.
Plus the efficiency of implementation is superior and second to none. When all
that we need is just this utility, it is an OVERKILL to install over 400 files
in the name of IT++ full package.

The result is a 38 file extract, instead of the total 400+ files.
